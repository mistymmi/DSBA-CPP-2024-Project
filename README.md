# DSBA-CPP-2024-Project
# Console Application for Clustering Data
## by Yakupova Maryam, Zhidkova Ekaterina, group 233-2
## Description:
The aim of the project is to show that the data science in C++ is easy and fast and show
how it works with simple algorithms and common example of 2d matrix of points. realization of 
DBSCAN and K-means were used in the project to cluster the points.
## Dataset:
The dataset provided for this project from kaggle is 2D clustering data, containing
two-dimensional clustering data and right clusterization. You will need to delete
column with right classes and make clusterization, after that you can compare
with right clusterization. Dataset includes the following fields:
1) x : Float
2) y : Float
3) color : integer
This dataset is ideal for showing the magic of clusterization algorithms for beginners because of its simplicity and demistartivness
## Features to Implement:
### 1. Clustering Algorithms:
• Input: Preprocessed matrix of two-dimensional data points.
• Number of clusters: Allow the user to specify the desired number of
clusters.
• Output: Marked clusters for input data.
### 2. Supplementary Functionality:
• Reading and Writing: Implement functions to read data from files and
write clustered data to files for easy storage and retrieval.
• Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation including usage
examples to guide users in utilizing the application and library
functionalities effectively.
## Additional Features:
### 1. Algorithm Flexibility:
• Provide different algorithms to compare the results of work and check the correctness and difference in work of two algorithms such as K-Means and DBSCAN.
### 2. Visualization Tool:
• Function which will interpret the results of the clusterization algorithm in a scatter plot with dots of different colors for each cluster.
### 3. Normalization function:
• Funcion which will normalize data for improving correctness of algorithms.
### 4. Parameter Tuning:
• Function which will find the most suitable hyperparameters combination with the most accurate results.
### 5. Exportable Results:
• Function for exporting the results in csv file.

By incorporating these additional features, the console application will not only
provide basic clustering functionalities but also offer flexibility, performance, and
user-friendliness, making it a valuable tool for data analysis tasks.
